The Coq proof assistant is a programming language for writing
proofs: https://coq.inria.fr/

It has been around since 1984 and was initially implemented by Thierry
Coquand and his PhD supervisor Gérard Huet. The first version, called
CoC, implemented the Calculus of Constructions as presented in:

"The Calculus of Constructions".
Thierry Coquand, Gérard Huet,
Information and Computation (1988). 76(2–3): 95–120.

It was later extended to the Calculus of Inductive Constructions and
the name changed to Coq. These type theories are similar to Martin-Löf
type theory, but there are some differences that I won't have time to
get into. As Coq is supposed to be a programming language for
developing proofs all programs have to be terminating, so it can be
seen as a "total" programming language.

The Coq system has a very long and detailed reference manual:

https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/

However, UniMath is only using a subset of Coq. So there is a lot of
information that is not relevant for UniMath development in there. The
fragment of Coq that UniMath uses consists of:

- Pi-types (with judgmental eta)
- Sigma-types (with judgmental eta/surjective pairing)
- Some inductive types: natural numbers, booleans, unit, empty
- Coproduct types
- A universe UU

The reason we only have one universe is that there is no support for
universe resizing axioms in Coq yet. Because of this we assume the
inconsistent rule UU : UU, but we are working on improving this so
that we can make use of Coq's universe consistency
checker. Furthermore, the reason UniMath only relies on this subset is
that everything in UniMath has to be motivated by the model in
simplicial sets.

In this lecture I will show some things than can be done in UniMath if
it is viewed as a programming language. In the later lectures we will
also see how to actually prove properties about definitions and
programs. The UniMath library can be found at:

https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath

This whole file is a Coq file and it hence has the file ending ".v" (v
for vernacular) and can be processed using:

- emacs with proof-general: https://proofgeneral.github.io/

- Coq IDE

I use emacs as it is also an extremely powerful text editor, but if
you never saw emacs before it might be quite overwhelming. If so I
think Coq IDE (interactive development environment) might be easier to
get started with and it has some features that emacs doesn't have so
some Coq experts use it as well. But in this talk I will use emacs.

In order to make emacs interact with Coq one should install Proof
General. This is an extension to emacs that enables it to interact
with a range of proof assistants, including Coq. For UniMath
development one should also install agda-mode in order to be able to
properly insert unicode characters.

The basic keybinding that I use when working in Proof General are:
<<
C-c C-n      -- Process one line
C-c C-u      -- Unprocess a line
C-c C-ENTER  -- Process the whole buffer until where the cursor is
C-c C-b      -- Process the whole file
C-c C-r      -- Unprocess (retract) the whole file
C-x C-c      -- Kill Coq process
>>
For more commands see:

https://proofgeneral.github.io/doc/master/userman/Basic-Script-Management/#Script-processing-commands
https://proofgeneral.github.io/doc/master/userman/Coq-Proof-General/#Coq_002dspecific-commands

Here C = CTRL and M = ALT on a standard emacs setup, so "C-c C-n"
means "press c while holding CTRL and then press n while still holding
CTRL" (note that the keybindings are case sensitive). ENTER is the
"return" key on my keyboard.

Various basic emacs commands:
<<
C-x C-f      -- Find file
C-x C-s      -- Save file
C-x C-x      -- Exit emacs
C-x b        -- Kill buffer
C-_          -- Undo
C-x 1        -- Maximize buffer
C-x 2        -- Split buffer horizontally
C-x 3        -- Split buffer vertically
M-%          -- Search-and-replace
M-;          -- Comment region

Google "emacs tutorial")

(** To import a file write:
<<
Require Import Dir.Filename.
>>
*)

(**

This will import the file Filename in the directory Dir. This assumes
that directory Dir is visible to Coq, that is, in the list of
directories in which Coq looks for files to import. If you are working
in the UniMath directory this Coq will be able to find all of the
files in the UniMath library, but if you are in another directory you
need to the update your LoadPath by running (where "/path/to/UniMath/"
is replaced to the path where UniMath is located on your computer):
<<
Add LoadPath "/path/to/UniMath".
>>

Coq has a quite fancy module system which allows you to import and
export definitions in various complicated ways. We extremely rarely
use this in UniMath so you can safely ignore it for now. The only
thing you need to know is that there is an alternative to Require
Import:
<<
Require Export Dir.Filename.
>>
that is used in some files. This will make the file your working on
import all of the definitions in Dir.Filename and then export them
again so that any file that imports this file also gets the
definitions in Dir.Filename. I personally only use Require Import.

Require Import UniMath.Foundations.Preamble.

(** * Definitions, lambda terms *)

(** The polymorphic identity function *)
Definition idfun : forall (A : UU), A -> A := fun (A : UU) (a : A) => a.

(** forall = Pi *)
(** fun = lambda *)

Check idfun.
Print idfun.

Definition idfun' (A : UU) (a : A) : A := a.

Check idfun'.
Print idfun'.

(** The constant function that returns its first argument *)
Definition const (A B : UU) (a : A) (b : B) : A := a.

(** The booleans come from the Coq standard library *)
About bool.
Print bool.

(** These are generated by true and false *)
Check true.
Check false.

(** They also come with an induction principle *)
About bool_rect.

(** Using this we can define a "recursion" principle *)
Definition ifbool (A : UU) (x y : A) : bool -> A :=
  bool_rect (fun _ : bool => A) x y.

(** We can define boolean negation: *)
Definition negbool : bool -> bool :=
  ifbool bool false true.

(** and compute with it *)
Eval compute in negbool true.

(** Coq supports many evaluation strategies, like cbn and cbv, for
details see:

https://coq.inria.fr/refman/tactics.html#Conversion-tactics

*)

(** boolean and *)
Definition andbool (b : bool) : bool -> bool :=
  ifbool (bool -> bool) (idfun bool) (const bool bool false) b.

Eval compute in andbool true true.
Eval compute in andbool true false.
Eval compute in andbool false true.
Eval compute in andbool false false.

(** Exercise: define boolean or:

Definition orbool : bool -> bool -> bool :=

*)

(** The natural numbers do no longer come from the Coq standard library (as of 2018) *)
About nat.
Print nat.

(** They are defined as Peano numbers, but we can use numerals *)
Check idfun nat 3.

(** This type also comes with an induction principle *)
Check nat_rect.

(** We can define the recursor: *)
Definition nat_rec (A : UU) (a : A) (f : nat -> A -> A) : nat -> A :=
  nat_rect (fun _ : nat => A) a f.

(**

This can be understood as a function defined by the following clauses:
<<
nat_rec m f 0 = m
nat_rec m f (S n) = f n (nat_rec m f n)
>>
*)

(** We can look at the normal form of the recursor by *)
Eval compute in nat_rec.

(** This contains a both a "fix" and "match _ with _". These primitives
of Coq are not allowed in UniMath. Instead we write everything using
recursors. The reason is that everything we write in UniMath has to be
justified by the simplicial set model and the situation for general
inductive types with match is unclear. *)

(** If you are used to regular programming languages it might seem very
strange to only program with the recursors, but it's actually not too
bad and we can do many programs quite directly *)

(** truncated predecessor *)
Definition pred : nat -> nat := nat_rec nat 0 (fun x _ => x).

Eval compute in pred 3.

(** We can test if a number is even by: *)
Definition even : nat -> bool := nat_rec bool true (fun _ b => negbool b).

Eval compute in even 3.
Eval compute in even 4.

(** Exercise: define a function odd that tests if a number is odd

Definition odd : nat -> bool :=

*)

(** Addition *)
Definition add (m : nat) : nat -> nat := nat_rec nat m (fun _ y => S y).

Eval compute in add 2 3.

(** We can define a nice notation for addition by: *)
Notation "x + y" := (add x y).

Eval compute in 4 + 9.

(** To find information about a notation we can write: *)
Locate "+".

(** Coq allows us to write very sophisticated notations, for details
see: https://coq.inria.fr/refman/syntax-extensions.html *)

(** In UniMath we use a lot of unicode. To input a unicode character
write \ and then the name of the symbol. For example \alpha gives
α. To get information about a unicode character, including how to
write it, put the cursor on top of the symbol and type: M-x
describe-char

In fact one can write:
<<
  λ x, e        instead of   fun x => e
  ∏ (x : A), T  instead of   forall (x : A), T
  A → B        instead of    A -> B
>>
*)

(** Iterate a function many times *)
Definition iter (A : UU) (a : A) (f : A → A) : nat → A :=
  nat_rec A a (λ _ y, f y).

(** A more fancy notation where the ̂ symbol is the unicode one (written \^ ) *)
Notation "f ̂ n" := (λ x, iter _ x f n) (at level 10).

Eval compute in pred ̂  2 5.

(** Exercise: define a notation "myif b then x else y" for "ifbool _ x y b"
and rewrite negbool and andbool using this notation.

Note that we cannot introduce the notation "if b then x else y" as
this is already used.

*)

Definition sub (m n : nat) : nat := pred ̂  n m.

Eval compute in sub 15 4.
Eval compute in sub 11 15.

(** Exercise: define addition using iter and S *)

Definition is_zero : nat → bool := nat_rec bool true (λ _ _, false).

Eval compute in is_zero 3.
Eval compute in is_zero 0.

Definition eqnat (m n : nat) : bool :=
  andbool (is_zero (sub m n)) (is_zero (sub n m)).

Notation "m == n" := (eqnat m n) (at level 30).

Eval compute in 5 == 5.
Eval compute in 5 == 3.
Eval compute in 9 == 5.

(** Exercises: define <, >, ≤, ≥ *)

(** Note that I could omit the A from the definition of f ̂ n and just
replace it by _. The reason is that Coq very often can infer what
arguments are so that we can omit them. *)

(** For example if I omit nat in *)
Check idfun _ 3.
(** Coq will figure it out for us *)

(** In fact we can tell Coq to always put _ for an argument by using
curly braces in the definition: *)

Definition idfun'' {A : UU} (a : A) : A := a.

Check idfun'' 3.
Check idfun'' true.

(** Such an argument is called an "implicit argument" and these are
very useful in order for us to get definitions that don't take too
many unnecessary arguments. However it is sometimes necessary to be
able to give all the arguments explicitly, this is achieved by putting
an @ in front of the function *)

Check @idfun'' nat 3.


(** * More inductive types *)

(** The inductive types we have seen so far come from the standard
library, but Coq allows us to define any inductive types we want. In
UniMath we don't allow this and the additional inductive types we have
are defined in Foundations. *)

(** One of these is the coproduct (disjoint union) of types *)
About coprod.
Print coprod.
Check inl.
Check inr.
Locate "ii1".
Locate "ii2".

Check (λ A B C : UU, @coprod_rect A B (λ _, C)).

Definition coprod_rec {A B C : UU} (f : A → C) (g : B → C) : A ⨿ B → C :=
  @coprod_rect A B (λ _, C) f g.

(** Define integers as a coproduct of nat with itself *)
(** +1 = inl 1 *)
(** 0 = inl 0 *)
(** -1 = inr 0 *)
(** Note that we get the negative numbers "off-by-one". We could also
have inl 0 and inr 0 representing zero, but this becomes quite strange
as we actually want to work with a quotient type where "inl 0 = inr
0". *)

Definition Z : UU := nat ⨿ nat.

Notation "⊹ x" := (inl x) (at level 20).
Notation "─ x" := (inr x) (at level 40).

Definition Z1 : Z := ⊹ 1.
Definition Z0 : Z := ⊹ 0.
Definition Zn3 : Z := ─ 2.

(** We can define a function by case on whether the number is ⊹ n or ─ n *)
Definition Zcase (A : UU) (fpos : nat → A) (fneg : nat → A) : Z → A :=
  coprod_rec fpos fneg.

Definition negate : Z → Z :=
  Zcase Z (λ x, ifbool Z Z0 (─ pred x) (is_zero x)) (λ x, ⊹ S x).

Eval compute in negate Z0.
Eval compute in negate Z1.
Eval compute in negate Zn3.

(** Exercise (harder): define addition for Z. *)

(** We also have two more inductive types: *)

(** The unit type with one inhabitant tt *)
About unit.
Print unit.

(** The empty type with no inhabitants *)
About empty.
Print empty.


(** * Sigma types *)

(** Sigma types are called total2 and this is the only example of a
Record in the whole UniMath library. The reason we use a record is so
that we can get surjective pairing. *)

About total2.
Print total2.

(** We have a notation ∑ (x : A), B for Sigma types *)

(** To form a pair use *)
Check tpair.
Locate ",,".

(** and to project out of a pair use *)
Check pr1.
Check pr2.

(** In PartA.v we define the direct product as a Sigma type *)
Definition dirprod (X Y : UU) := ∑ x : X, Y.

Notation "A × B" := (dirprod A B) (at level 75, right associativity) : type_scope.

Definition dirprod_pr1 {X Y : UU} : X × Y -> X := pr1.
Definition dirprod_pr2 {X Y : UU} : X × Y -> Y := pr2.

Definition dirprodf {X Y X' Y' : UU} (f : X -> Y) (f' : X' -> Y')
  (xx' : X × X') : Y × Y' := (f (pr1 xx'),,f' (pr2 xx')).

Definition swap {X Y : UU} (xy : X × Y) : Y × X :=
  dirprodf dirprod_pr2 dirprod_pr1 (xy,,xy).

(** We can define the type of even numbers as a Sigma-type: *)
Definition even_nat : UU :=
  ∑ (n : nat), ifbool _ unit empty (even n).

Definition test20 : even_nat := (20,,tt).

(** This Definition does not work *)
Fail Definition test3 : even_nat := (3,,tt).

(** Section's can be very useful to only write parameters that are used
many times once and for all. They are also useful for organizing your
files into logical sections. *)
Section curry.

Variables A B C : UU.

(** To make these arguments implicit use:
<<
Context {A B C : UU}.
>>
*)

Definition curry : (A × B → C) → (A → B → C) :=
  λ (f : A × B → C) (a : A) (b : B), f (a,,b).

Definition uncurry : (A → B → C) → (A × B → C) :=
  λ (f : A → B → C) (ab : A × B), f (pr1 ab) (pr2 ab).

End curry.

Check curry.
Print curry.
Check uncurry.
Print uncurry.


(** These were all the basics for interacting with Coq in this
lecture. The UniMath library is a very large library and so far we
have only seen parts of Preamble.v. When writing programs and proofs
in UniMath it is very important to be able to search the library so
that you don't do something someone else has already done. *)

(** To find everything about nat type: *)
Search nat.

(** To search for all lemmas involving the pattern *)
(* Search _ (_ -> _ <= _). *)

(** To find information about a notation *)
Locate "+".

(** More information about searching can be found in the reference
manual. *)

(**

One can also generate HTML documentation for UniMath that is a bit
easier to browse than reading text files. This is done by typing:
<<
> make html
>>
You can then open this documentation in your browser:
<<
> firefox html/toc.html
>>
In order to have your comments display properly in the HTML use the
following format:

(** This comment will be displayed *)
(** * This will be displayed as a section header *)
(** ** This will be a subsection *)

For more details see:

https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/tools.html#coqdoc

*)

(**

The UniMath library is organized into a collection of packages that
can be found in the UniMath folder. The library is then compiled using
a Makefile which specifies in which order things has to be compiled
and how they should be compiled.

In order to have your file get compiled when you type "make" add it to
the .package/files file of the package where it belongs. See for
example: UniMath/UniMath/Foundations/.package/files

If you're working on a new package then you need to add it to the
Makefile by writing:

PACKAGES += MyPackage
